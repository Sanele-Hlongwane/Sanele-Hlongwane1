## Installation

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```

### 3. Set Up TypeScript (If not automatically set up)

If you haven't run the development server yet, running it will automatically set up TypeScript for the project:
